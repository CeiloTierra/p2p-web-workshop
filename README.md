## What is the peer-to-peer (p2p) Web?

The p2p Web is a loose term for describing the community of websites and applications that are transported with a p2p protocol (like [`dat://`](https://github.com/datproject/dat)).

The traditional Web uses [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) to host websites, which means that to run a website, you have to know how to set up and maintain a server. The p2p Web aims to reinvigorate independent publishing on the Web by making it practical and fun for *anybody* to create and host a website.
